RELAX NG to TextMate language  grammar generator
================================================

The aim of this is to automatically generate *TextMate language grammars* from
*RELAX NG XML Schemas*. As both TextMate grammars and RELAX NG
Schemas can be written as XML, our program mainly consists of a XSLT
transformation.

Note that RELAX NG can be generated from DTDs or W3C XML Schemas using
tools such as Trang.

Usage
-----

*Currently, XML namespace are not dealt with. One have to modify the RNG so
that the RNG namespace is the* default *namespace — both empty and not
defined. See known issues.*

./rng2txmt.sh schema.rng

Generates the language grammars schema.plist.xml and schema.plist in the
"Generated Language Grammars" repository.

Prerequisites
-------------

Everything should run directly on any Mac OS X Leopard. Developer
Tools might need to be installed.

* xsltproc (compiled with exslt support)
* plutil
* a sh compatible shell

Current features
----------------

What it currently does. Not many things.

* look for and mark invalid tags or attributes under or in a given tag
* avoid to create empty repository entries
* give a tag-aware scope for attributes (aim is to generate auto-completion
lists aside)

Expected features
-----------------

What I would like it to do at some point.

* improve scope definitions
* [in progress] have parent-tag-aware scopes for auto-completion of tags, i.e.

        <a> <b/> </a> <!-- b is in a scope related to a -->
        <b attr="value" /> <!-- attribute is in a scope related to b -->
* actually generate completion list.
* have basic namespace support

Known issues
------------

Issues which are not on considered a priority or currently seem unavoidable.

* TextMate language grammars are deterministic. I thus don’t think it’s
possible to generate (exact) grammars from non-deterministic RNG schemas.
However, these are rare in real-life. In particular, both DTDs and
W3C XML Schemas always are deterministic.
* Dealing with XML namespace (especially default namespace) in XSLT
stylesheets is quite a mess. Currently, only the default namespace is dealt
with. Currently, one thus have to make edits
* No management of many RNG construction.
* No management of file reference.
* No indentation of the generated plist. TextMate can however indent results
by itself.
* Probably too many scopes.
